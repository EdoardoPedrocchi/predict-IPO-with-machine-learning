# predict-IPO-with-machine-learning
develop  a machine learning model that can predict the success or failure of a companies IPO. Is it possible?


when a company decides to make an IPO is a crucial moment.
success or failure? life or death?

what if it were possible to develop a machine learning model that could predict what will happen after the IPO?
i tried to create it. could i have succeeded?


THE MODEL

I created a model using only data from the financial statements of companies that succeeded or failed in their IPOs.

this means that I have excluded relevant data such as the macroeconomic situation, the sector of the company, the situation of the financial market 

why?

the aim of this first model is not to be the most accurate ever, but to see whether one can predict IPO performance from the company's financial statement alone.

a model comprising more variables and aiming for a much more accurate prediction will be developed later. 
so: STAY TUNED.

do you want to know the results of the test? [see my presentation](https://github.com/EdoardoPedrocchi/predict-IPO-with-machine-learning/blob/main/IPO_final.pdf)

would you also like to try out the model? 
please do so, but mention and contact me!
